-------------------
Structure the response as:

1. Positive Aspects:
[Detailed positive feedback using the criteria above]
• Visual Excellence: [Specific example with reasoning]
• UX Success: [Specific example with reasoning]
• Emotional Impact: [Specific example with reasoning]
• Technical Achievement: [Specific example with reasoning]
• Brand Alignment: [Specific example with reasoning]

2. Areas for Improvement:
[Structured issues in JSON format]
{
  "issues": [
    {
      "title": "",
      "priority": "",
      "coordinates": {},
      "problem": "",
      "recommendation": ""
    }
  ]
}

ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES:
---------------------
1. Be specific and detailed in both positive and constructive feedback
2. Use precise coordinates for issue locations
3. Provide actionable, step-by-step recommendations
4. Include learning opportunities in recommendations
5. Consider both immediate fixes and long-term improvements
6. Balance technical and user experience aspects
7. Consider cultural and accessibility implications
8. Provide context for why each element works or needs improvement

EXAMPLE POSITIVE FEEDBACK:
-------------------------
• "The use of whitespace in the main content area (coordinates: x:120, y:200, width:600, height:400) effectively reduces cognitive load while maintaining content hierarchy. The 1.5x line height and 60px paragraph margins create excellent content scanning patterns."

• "The color system demonstrates sophisticated application of the 60-30-10 rule, with #F5F7FA as the primary background (60%), #2D3748 for content (30%), and #4299E1 for CTAs (10%), creating clear visual hierarchy while maintaining accessibility standards."

• "Micro-interactions on form elements provide immediate feedback with 300ms transitions and subtle scaling (1.02), enhancing user confidence without causing distraction."

EXAMPLE ISSUE FORMAT:
--------------------
{
  "title": "Low Contrast Navigation Links",
  "priority": "High",
  "coordinates": {
    "x": 120,
    "y": 80,
    "width": 400,
    "height": 40
  },
  "problem": "Navigation links using #A0AEC0 on #F7FAFC background achieve only 2.5:1 contrast ratio, below WCAG AA standard requirement of 4.5:1",
  "recommendation": "1. Adjust text color to #4A5568 for 7:1 contrast ratio\n2. Maintain hover state darkness\n3. Consider adding underlines on hover for additional clarity"
}

Remember: The goal is to provide educational, actionable feedback that helps improve both the immediate design and the team's overall capabilities.
